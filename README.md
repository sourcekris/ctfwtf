# CTFWTF? - Primer and Getting Started With CTF?

A Capture the Flag (CTF) competition is a popular form of cybersecurity challenge where participants test their skills and knowledge in various areas of computer security. The main objective of a CTF is to solve a series of tasks or puzzles, referred to as challenges, to obtain "flags." Flags are usually unique strings of text that serve as proof of successfully completing a particular challenge and look like these examples:

```
flag{792fc9a33cd84267c3ab4a350216bd02}
ctfname{792fc9a33cd84267c3ab4a350216bd02}
flag{S0m3_l33t_sp34k_73x7!!!}
```

## Types of CTF Competitions

There are two common formats of CTF competitions: Jeopardy style CTFs and Attack-Defense CTFs.

1. **Jeopardy style CTFs**: In this format, challenges are organized into different categories, similar to the Jeopardy game show. Each category represents a specific aspect of cybersecurity, such as cryptography, web exploitation, reverse engineering, binary exploitation, forensics, or network security. Each challenge is assigned a certain number of points based on its difficulty level, and participants attempt to solve as many challenges as possible within a given time frame. Points are awarded for successfully solving challenges, and the team or individual with the highest score at the end of the competition is declared the winner.

2. **Attack-Defense CTFs**: This format involves teams competing against each other in a simulated networked environment. Each team is provided with a set of virtual machines or systems, which they must defend from attacks by other teams while simultaneously launching attacks on the opponents' systems. The objective is to find and exploit vulnerabilities in the opponents' systems while securing and patching their own. Points are scored based on successful attacks or defenses, such as capturing flags from opponent systems or successfully defending against attacks.

## Scoring Points

In both formats, points are typically awarded based on the difficulty of the challenge or the success of an attack or defense. The organizers assign a specific value to each challenge or successful action, and participants accumulate points as they progress. The scoring system may vary between competitions, but it generally rewards speed, accuracy, and creativity in solving challenges or conducting successful attacks.

## CTF Challenge Categories

The challenges in a CTF competition cover a wide range of categories, depending on the focus of the competition and the organizers' preferences. Some common categories include:

1. **Cryptography**: Challenges involving encryption, decryption, code breaking, or analyzing cryptographic protocols.
2. **Web Exploitation**: Challenges related to web application vulnerabilities, such as cross-site scripting (XSS), SQL injection, or server misconfigurations.
3. **Reverse Engineering**: Tasks that involve analyzing and understanding compiled or binary code to find vulnerabilities or extract hidden information.
4. **Binary Exploitation**: Challenges focused on exploiting vulnerabilities in compiled programs or binaries, such as buffer overflows or format string vulnerabilities.
5. **Forensics**: Challenges that require examining and analyzing digital artifacts, such as network traffic logs, memory dumps, or file metadata, to uncover hidden information or solve puzzles.
6. **Network Security**: Challenges related to network protocols, packet analysis, network reconnaissance, or securing network infrastructure.
7. **Steganography**: Challenges involving the extraction or analysis of hidden information within images, audio files, or other media.
8. **OSINT (Open Source Intelligence)**: Participants gather and analyze publicly available information from online sources to uncover hidden data, solve challenges, and demonstrate investigative skills.
9. **Miscellaneous**: Miscellaneous challenges that don't fit into specific categories, such as trivia questions, general knowledge puzzles, or unconventional tasks.

These categories provide a diverse set of challenges, allowing participants to showcase their skills in various areas of computer security and encouraging them to think creatively and critically in order to solve complex problems.
